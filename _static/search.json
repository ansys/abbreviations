This simplicity and standardization make it easy\nfor different systems to communicate and exchange data effectively.\nRPC\nRemote procedure call: A powerful software communication protocol used\nin distributed client-server programs. An RPC is a request message\ninitiated by a client program to a known remote server to execute a\nspecified procedure with supplied parameters. The remote server sends a\nresponse to the client, and the app continues its process. RPC is more\nefficient than REST in terms of speed, memory, and payload size.\nTypically, the use of REST should be limited to short messages\ntransferred via JSON files, and gRPC should be used for large data\ntransfers and bidirectional streaming.\nRMI\nRemote method invocation: An API that allows an object to invoke a\nmethod on an object that exits in another address space, which could be\non the same machine or on a remote machine. The Java RMI is the\nobject-oriented equivalent of an RPC (remote procedure) for Java, with\nsupport for direct transfer of serialized Java classes and distributed\ngarbage-collection.\nRST\nResult structural: A proprietary file format in which Ansys Mechanical\nwrites simulation results from a structural analysis.\nreStructured Text: A file format and markup language that software\ndevelopers and technical documentation writers use to produce\ndocumentation for Python-based software programs.\nRTH\nResult thermal: A proprietary file format in which Ansys Mechanical\nwrites simulation results for a thermal analysis.\nP - Q - R"
